            Initiated <strong>in 2018 by founders Lysha and her inferior assistant, Aayan,</strong> Beast Battle has approximately <strong>sixty-nine million players</strong> (more accurately, two.. who are the two founders) as of August 2020, and <strong>over 150 Beast Battle cards</strong> and counting.

            4 years later, in 2022, founder Lysha has kicked off the production of a digital adaptation of the exisiting Beast Battle game. Presently, only a much simpler rendition of the game has been made. There are plans for the production of an official game that perfectly replicates and is an improved version of the original game in the near future. Today, the much simpler model features only 18 cards.

        <div class="heading"> GAMEPLAY </div>
        <div class="card-content">
          <p>A game of Beast Battle involves two or more players who are engaged in a battle. Players shuffle the deck and equally distribute beasts and accessories among all the players. A player starts the game with "life points" equal to the number of their beasts and loses the game when their life total is reduced to zero.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Players begin a round by shuffling their decks and then drawing four beasts and accessories. Before battle phase, players decide which beast among the four in their hand is most appropriate for each lane. Furthermore, they must study the accessories in their hand and make calculations to decide what accessories to cast and when. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Then, players enter battle phase and start combat. All beasts engage in attack against beasts in the corresponding lanes. The beast with a higher value in its particular lane conquers the opposing beast. However, the player may counter the attack with an appropriate accessory. Most actions that a player can perform enter the "Stack", as either player can react to these actions with other actions using accessories; the stack provides a method of resolve complex interactions that may result in certain scenarios. </p>
          <br>
          <p>The lanes each card has to be placed on is; Age, Power, Magic Level and Fright Factor, respectively from right to left</p>

          <p class="title is-2.5">CLASSES</p>
          <p>Cards in Beast Battle fall into generally four classes: </p>  
          <li>Beasts</li>
          <li>Accessories</li>
          <li>Places</li>
          <li>Spirits</li>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Beasts</strong> are the battle units summoned in game. <strong>Accessories</strong> come in several varieties: non-permanents have a single, one-time effect before they go to the "graveyard" (discard pile); some accessories remain in play after being cast to provide a lasting effect for a number of turns. <strong>Place cards</strong> can be tapped for mana  which enhances the abilities of the beast in relation to its lane. <strong>Spirits</strong> are drawn when a player potentially has 3 remaining rounds, which serves as a drawback, hence enabling the weaker player to force a comeback. </p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Note: Accessory cards, Spirit cards and Place cards are NOT yet a feature of the digital version of the game</strong></p>

          <p class="title is-2.5">STANDARD</p>
          <p>Standard is the earliest and most common format for Beast Battle. Evolving gameplay and fresh strategies make it one of the most fun and popular ways to play Beast Battle. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Being the default format, it follows all rules described above in the section gameplay.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="title is-2.5">DRAFT</p>
          <p>The most recently added format introduces a new brand of deck building to the universe of Beast Battle. </p>
          <br>
          <p>At the start of draft, decide the order in which players can choose cards. The first player must draw 7 cards from the top of a shuffled deck of accessories. They must choose any two cards (Donâ€™t show the other players what you pick!). Then they pass the rest of their hand to player on their left, they then must draw two more cards from the deck of accessories  before choosing any two from the entire hand and passing again. This process continues until all the cards in the deck have been drafted. </p>
          <br>
          <p>After building your decks, the main gameplay follows all rules as standard.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Note: DRAFT is NOT yet a feature of the digital version of the game</strong></p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <p><strong>AdamBankeeCuber</strong> reviewed Beast Battle in <strong>Pyramid #4 (Nov./Dec., 1993)</strong>, and stated that "Not only is Beast Battle the best gaming bargain to come down the pike in memory; not only is it the most original idea in years; it's also a delightfully addictive game that you and your friends will find impossible to put down."</p>
          <br>
          <p>A 1969 article in <strong>YourMoms</strong> suggested that playing Beast Battle might help improve the social and mental skills of some of the players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Beast Battle also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Beast Battle helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions that Beast Battle can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Beast Battle obsession.</p>
          <br>
          <p><strong>Phosphorous42069</strong>, an American street pharmacist and entrepreneur, commented, "I love games that challenge and change our definition of adventure gaming, and Beast Battle is definitely one of a very short list of titles that has accomplished that elusive goal. By combining the collecting and trading elements of baseball cards with the fantasy play dynamics of role-playing games, Beast Battle created a whole new genre of product that changed this industry forever." </p>
